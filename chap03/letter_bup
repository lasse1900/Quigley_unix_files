Hi tom,
I think I failed my antomy test yesterday. I had a terrible
stomachache. I ate many fried green tomatoes.
Anyway, Tom, I need your help. I'd like to make the test up
tomorrow, nut don't know where to beging studying. Do you
think you could help me? After work, about 7 PM, come to
my place and I'll treat you to pizza in return for your help. Thanks.
	Your pal,
guy@phantom
